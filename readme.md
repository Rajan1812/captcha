This code will generate Captcha image which includes upper and lower case character along with the digits.
You will need to import few of the python modules mentioned in the code. The code to import them is given in the main file(cap.py).
You just need to download the file and execute after importing the modules.

Note:- Do NOT name the file as "captcha.py" as it causes some conflit with the module name and will throw error saying module not installed even though you have installed it.
